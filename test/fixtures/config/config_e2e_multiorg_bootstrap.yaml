# UrlSubstitutionExp can be empty which means the same network hostname will be used
# UrlSubstitutionExp can be given same as mapped peer url, so that mapped peer url can be used
# UrlSubstitutionExp can have golang regex matchers like ${1}.local.example.${2}:${3} for pattern
 # like peer0.org1.example.com:1234 which converts peer0.org1.example.com to peer0.org1.local.example.com:1234

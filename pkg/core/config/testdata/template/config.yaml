channels:

#        #[Optional] load-balancer type. Possible values: [RoundRobin,Random]
#        Balancer: RoundRobin
#        #[Optional] the number of blocks from the highest block number of a group of peers that a peer
#        #can lag behind and still be considered to be up-to-date. These peers will be sorted using the
#        #given Balancer. If a peer's block height falls behind this threshold then it will be demoted
#        #to a lower priority list of peers which will be sorted according to block height.
#        #Note: This property only applies to BlockHeightPriority sorter.
#        BlockHeightLagThreshold: 5
#      #[Optional] options for event service
#      eventService:
#        # [Optional] resolverStrategy specifies the peer resolver strategy to use when connecting to a peer
#        # Possible values: [PreferOrg (default), MinBlockHeight, Balanced]
#        #
#        # PreferOrg:
#        #   Determines which peers are suitable based on block height lag threshold, although will prefer the peers in the
#        #   current org (as long as their block height is above a configured threshold). If none of the peers from the current org
#        #   are suitable then a peer from another org is chosen.
#        # MinBlockHeight:
#        #   Chooses the best peer according to a block height lag threshold. The maximum block height of all peers is
#        #   determined and the peers whose block heights are under the maximum height but above a provided "lag" threshold are load
#        #   balanced. The other peers are not considered.
#        # Balanced:
#        #   Chooses peers using the configured balancer.
#        resolverStrategy: PreferOrg
#        # [Optional] balancer is the balancer to use when choosing a peer to connect to
#        # Possible values: [Random (default), RoundRobin]
#        balancer: Random
#        # [Optional] blockHeightLagThreshold sets the block height lag threshold. This value is used for choosing a peer
#        # to connect to. If a peer is lagging behind the most up-to-date peer by more than the given number of
#        # blocks then it will be excluded from selection.
#        # If set to 0 then only the most up-to-date peers are considered.
#        # If set to -1 then all peers (regardless of block height) are considered for selection.
#        # Default: 5
#        blockHeightLagThreshold: 5
#        # [Optional] reconnectBlockHeightLagThreshold - if >0 then the event client will disconnect from the peer if the peer's
#        # block height falls behind the specified number of blocks and will reconnect to a better performing peer.
#        # If set to 0 then this feature is disabled.
#        # Default: 10
#        # NOTES:
#        #   - peerMonitorPeriod must be >0 to enable this feature
#        #   - Setting this value too low may cause the event client to disconnect/reconnect too frequently, thereby
#        #     affecting performance.
#        reconnectBlockHeightLagThreshold: 10
#        # [Optional] peerMonitorPeriod is the period in which the connected peer is monitored to see if
